Wiki statistics:

4758 deals with an own Wiki page, at least 330 days from other instances
     of the same deal
 522 deals that are only listed on Prüfung pages, and are at least
     330 days from other instances of the same deal
 232 deals that are doubles,i.e. within 330 days
 233 entries that do not qualify as deals
----
5745 entries

The double deals are shown in doubles.txt:
- First entry is the deal number in the Wiki
- Second entry is the deal number which causes it to be a double
- Third entry is the number of calendar days between the two

The unspecific entries are shown in unspecific.txt:
- First entry is the deal number in the Wiki
- Then follows a brief reason that it's not a deal

Affinity statistics (as of today -- keeps growing):

4758 deals with an own Wiki page (same number as above)
 522 deals listed on Prüfung pages (same number as above)
 172 deals that only have SharePoint pages, no Wiki pages
  15 deals that would normally trigger warnings in my scripts,
     for example because the Affinity deal is too close in time
     to another Affinity deal (I've been more lenient in allowing
     this than in the Wiki)
----
5467 deals

The 15 deals are shown in aff_exist_txt.


The scripts are run as follows.

fetch:
python3 fetch.py pages.txt
(fetched files go in data directory)

wiki:
perl table.pl ../fetch/data/Pr*txt > out.txt

The output file contains a bunch of debugging output and comparisons.
Copy it to wikireal.txt, and delete everything except the 4758 lines
(including the header).

Also copy the output file to wpruf.txt, and delete everything except
the 522 lines (including the header) for the Prüfung deals.

affinity:

In Affinity, do a csv export of the deal list.
There is a specimen in 2020-06-29-Affinity.csv

Copy the relevant files from wiki to affinity.

perl aff.pl 2020-06-29-Affinity.csv wikireal.txt wpruf.txt > out.txt

This generates some debug output but should look reasonably clean.
