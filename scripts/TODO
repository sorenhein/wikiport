Some deals should be split into several rounds (A, B, ...)

Compare dates to Oliver's

Can Klaus Feix be an owner without having an account?

Use field Reasons to decline better

New segmentation of MIG deal categories

Parse sub-directories of a deal for further information
- A wiki page is like a directory and a file in one
- In Python, a link goes in company__ directory
- Make a list of all subs (perl script)
- Don't re-download a page in Python that we already have
- In parse.pl, only scan top-level pages
- But recurse somehow over embedded pages
- Download at least the mail attachments?

Play around with getting the HTML and preserving links (rebasing them).

In the end, check that "all deal pages" are referenced in Affinity.


Move portfolio out of deal list into portfolio.txt

Are the many pages that are not linked strictly hierarchically?

Do use the permission knowledge (PipelineGroup as well?)
